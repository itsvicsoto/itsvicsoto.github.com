### Welcome to my hackerrrry page!

I try to compile as much information as I can while developing for future
reference. Docs might be dirty but I'll keep everything as neat as possible.
This includes best practices ranging from front-end framework, javascript
snippets, css or even random stuff I just want to note.

Some of them are listed here :

*  [Inspiration](/cheatsheets/inspiration)
*  [Angular](/cheatsheets/angular)
*  [JQuery](/cheatsheets/jquery)
*  [whatever-nix](/cheatsheets/whatever-nix)
*  [wordpress](/cheatsheets/wordpress)
*  [OSX Developer Setup](/cheatsheets/osx-developer-setup)
