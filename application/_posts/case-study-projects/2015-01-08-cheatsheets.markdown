### Welcome to my hackerrrry page!

I try to compile as much information as I can while developing for future
reference. Docs might be dirty but I'll keep everything as neat as possible.
This includes best practices ranging from front-end framework, javascript
snippets, css or even random stuff I just want to note.

Some of them are listed here :

*  [Angular](/cheatsheets/angular)
*  [JQuery](/cheatsheets/jquery)
